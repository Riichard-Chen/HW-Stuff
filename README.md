<h2>On the Warlord Era</h2>

<p> How can one even begin to describe the Warlord Era?<br>
Opinions on the era vary, and information on it is scarce at best. Photos are even harder to find.<br>
But, to be brief, the Warlord Era was a unique period in Chinese History from 1912-1939, between the Xinhai Revolution and the 2nd World War.<br>

To make a long story short, it began when Yuan Shikai had Song Jiaoren killed and declared himself Emperor of China. At this, he failed. <br>
A coalition of Southern Governors re-installed the Republic, but after 1915, the government was attacked by a Monarchist Rebel Army that briefly restored the Qing Dynasty. <br>
In addition, lots of political shenanigans such as mass election fraud and broad corruption by the Army lead to a weak central government, as well as the "Anfu" clique seizing power in the Government. <br>
They were then challenged by the Zhilli Clique, lead by angry generals opposed the Anfu dominance. This is actually a very explanation of the Warlord Era, but it's too long to detail here.

<h2>On Hanfu</h2>

<p>Hanfu is a complex topic I can't do justice in this webpage.<br>
The simple explanation of it is all Chinese Ancient Clothing before 1644. While many people associate the Cheongsam, Qipao, and whatever those weird jackets Bush wore at the Olympics were, this is actually not really Chinese clothing. <br>
In 1644, China was conquered by the Manchus, a group from the Northern Manchurian plains, a region not traditionally part of China. Due to certain policies and factors, as well as a brutal occupation policy, many people ended up adopting their manner of dress as well. <br>
Prior to 1644 however, there had been a rich continuity of traditional styles and fashions stretching back to at least the Zhou Dynasty, rooted in ancient religion and beliefs. <br>
After the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, there were several attempts to revive this fashion, but most have failed until the 21st Century due to a widespread interest once again in Tradition in China.

<h2>Philly Cheese Steak Rant</h2>

<p>I'll make this brief.<br>
<b>STOP PUTTING ONIONS IN CHEESE STEAKS</b><br>
Serously. Nobody from philadelphia puts vegetables in Cheese steaks. A cheese steak is bread, meat, and cheese, and maybe sometimes other stuff. <b>BUT NEVER ONIONS</b>
Just stop please. Just don't do this anymore.
